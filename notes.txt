System Design
- process of defining the architecture, components and interfaces of a system to meet specific business requirements.

Core concepts of System Design:
1. Scalability: ability of a system to handle increasing amount of work by adding resources
  - Vertical scaling: Adding more CPU, RAM to an existing machine
  - Hortizonal scaling: Adding more machines to your network
2. Load Balancing: Distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overloaded
3. Availability vs Consistency: According to CAP theorem, a distributed system can only guarantee two out of three: Consistency, Availability and Partition
4. Caching: Storing copies of data in high-speed storage like Redis
5. Polyglot Persitence: Selecting one database based on application's requirement

Architectural Patterns:
1. Monolithic: Single, unified codebase. Simple to develop but difficult to scale
2. Microservices: Small, Independent services that communicate via APIs. This is used for large-scale application development
3. Event-Driven: Uses events (like order-placed, payment successfull) to trigger actions across different services, using tools like Kafka


HLD - High Level Design: drawing a board diagram of server, database and caches
LLD - Deep dive into specific database schemas, API endpoints, class structures

=============================

URL Shortener
1. Setup a backend project using Node
2. Create a proper project structure with MVC
3. Write a simple Express server

CAP Theorem
Caching
Distributed Systems
High Availability
Event Pipelines
Database indexing
Load Balancing

Functional Requirements
- Shorten a long URL
- Redirect Short URL -> original URL
- Click Count / analytics

Non-Functional Requirements
- Fast Redirect
- High Availability
- Scalable to millions of URLs

Components:
1. Client - Front-end - Postman
2. Backend API 
3. Database - Mongo + Redis
